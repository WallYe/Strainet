This is a Pytorch 2D version of the STRAINet. Of course, I have a lot of new functions implemented besides the ones I mention in TNNLS.
As I have deleted some sensitve new functions, the codes may have some bugs in some cases. If you have any problems about the code, please contact dongnie@cs.unc.edu

The main entrance is runGAN.py.

I'll upload explanations in later days.
